## Overview

This project aims to implement all major data structures in C. Each data structures includes basic operations like insertion , deletion , and search and also provides a quick reference for time complexity.

## List of Data Structures

1. **Arrays**
2. **Linked Lists**
3. **Stack and Queues**
4. **Trees**
5. **Graphs**
6. **Heaps**
7. **Hash Tables**
8. **Disjoint Sets**

## Installation 

Clone the repository and compile any of the data structure files using a C compiler.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Saikat-too/DataStructure.git || git@github.com:Saikat-too/DataStructure.git

cd DataStructure
```
